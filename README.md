In this repo, I'll be adding the practice website related to the Recipes project
that The Odin Project has provided for me.

An outline of this project can be found at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

Update 8/5/23 - I have learned the basics of CSS. With this new iteration,
I wanted to create something reminiscent of those garbage websites from the
late 90's. You know, the ones that make your head hurt to look at. Enjoy!
(NOTE: I'm very aware that this does not follow W3C web standards.)
